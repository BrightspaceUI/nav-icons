# nav-icons

These are the icons used by the image-based navigation bar.

## Stored on the CDN

The icons are published to the Brightspace CDN here:

> https://s.brightspace.com/lib/nav-icons/<version>/<icon>.svg

Do not reference the icons from GitHub, use the CDN location.

## Udpating Icons

If you need update, add or remove an icon, submit a pull request. Once approved and merged, the changes will need to be manually re-published to the CDN in a new version directory, and the LMS will need to be manually updated to reference the new version.
